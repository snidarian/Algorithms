Breakfast routine procedure/algorithm

*items will be numbered in the order that they occur irrespective of which header they all are under*


### Notes:

- Two forks are taken out so one can be used as a whisk and the other can be used both for the purpose of slicing a chunk of butter and as a utensil to eat the eggs after they are cooked and procedure is finished.

- The eggs are prepared while the pan is heating and before the time to pan finishes heating the butter to the required temperature, the eggs are already ready to be poured in

- The heating of the pan is important for the following reason - and it is very important. As long as the pan and butter are hot enough when the egg mixture is poured in, there will be ZERO cleaning afterwards. The pan can simply be wiped with a paper towel and is ready to go for the next time. If the pan and butter are hot enough when the egg mixture first contacts it, then the bottom layer of the egg mixture will instantly solidify and in a way where it does not cling to the pan. This can be counted on to work EVERY TIME as long as it is carried out properly.

- eggs are important for the nutritional value of this meal just as are vegetables. Vegetables provide much needed plant celolose for gut bacteria which is a food source for them. Improving gut bacteria is a sure way to better overall health

- it is important that no part of the egg is left uncooked. A czeck military cook once told me that uncooked egg-white hinders the ability of the lining of the intestines to process nutrients. I supposed salmonela is a secondary concern but I'm not particularly worried about it. Still it's a best practice to cook the eggs all the way through for multiple reasons
